There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Panacea - Disease Tracker ##

  Panacea helps raise awareness of health threats across the globe by using crowdsourcing to track and report disease outbreaks.

## Crowdsourcing for Disease Prevention ##

Panacea is a web app that aims to provide early notification of health threats to people across the world, helping to increase response times for health organizations and raise awareness of health risks in the general population. Preventing the spread of infectious diseases is a time-critical issue. Diseases can spread faster than traditional news outlets can detect and report them. Social media, on the other hand, can provide instant updates on events as they occur. Panacea collects and analyzes social media for data on disease outbreaks, while also collecting direct reports from users via text. Outbreak zones are visualized on an interactive and intuitive world map. Users can search by disease or location, and can click on areas of the map to get more information. 

Panacea also strives to provide outbreak information and alerts to those who have limited access to the internet, particularly in developing countries. While many people may not use the internet in parts of the world, cell phones are becoming increasingly commonplace everywhere. Panacea aims to bridge the information gap by sending text alerts to users about outbreaks at locations they specify. People can also report outbreaks to Panacea via text.

## Customer Quote ##

"Panacea reported a measles outbreak at a local daycare days before it appeared on the news. Because of that, I was able to keep my child who is too young for the vaccination away from that area."
