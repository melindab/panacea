# Panacea - Disease Tracker #

Panacea helps raise awareness of health threats across the globe by using crowdsourcing to track and report disease outbreaks.

## Crowdsourcing for Disease Prevention ##

Panacea is a web app that aims to provide early notification of health threats to people across the world, helping to increase response times for health organizations and raise awareness of health risks in the general population. Preventing the spread of infectious diseases is a time-critical issue. Diseases can spread faster than traditional news outlets can detect and report them. Social media, on the other hand, can provide instant updates on events as they occur. Panacea collects and analyzes social media for data on disease outbreaks, while also collecting direct reports from users via text. Outbreak zones are visualized on an interactive and intuitive world map. Users can search by disease or location, and can click on areas of the map to get more information. 

Panacea also strives to provide outbreak information and alerts to those who have limited access to the internet, particularly in developing countries. While many people may not use the internet in parts of the world, cell phones are becoming increasingly commonplace everywhere. Panacea aims to bridge the information gap by sending text alerts to users about outbreaks at locations they specify. People can also report outbreaks to Panacea via text.

"Panacea reported a measles outbreak at a local daycare days before it appeared on the news. Because of that, I was able to keep my child who is too young for the vaccination away from that area."
